## Logs

There is a running log of the process in `$HOME/.hms-mirror/logs/hms-mirror.log`.  Review this for details or issues of the running process.

## Reports

When the process has completed a markdown report is generated with all the work that was done.  The report location will be at the bottom of the output window.  You will need a *markdown* renderer to read the report.  Markdown is a textfile, so if you don't have a renderer you can still look at the report, it will just be harder to read.
